I went through your PPT content, and it’s already well-structured with solution overview, architecture, novelty, and impact. To strengthen your hackathon pitch for KYCmitra, here’s a refined unique implementation plan that combines AWS Bedrock, IBM Watsonx AI stack, Blockchain, and customer accessibility:

Implementation Plan for KYCmitra
1. Customer Journey (Front-End)

Omni-channel access: Mobile app + web portal with multilingual conversational assistant (Watson Assistant + Bedrock LLM fallback).

Seamless Onboarding: Upload ID (Aadhaar/PAN/Passport), business docs (for KYB), or capture live selfie/video.

Trust & Transparency: Customer gets instant progress tracker (e.g., “Verification in progress → Screening → Risk Scoring → Completed”).

2. Back-End Architecture

Step-by-Step Flow:

Document Capture & Extraction

IBM Granite multimodal models for OCR + schema extraction.

Confidence scoring (flag anomalies like expired IDs, mismatch with registry).

Regulatory Knowledge Integration

Hybrid RAG (Watsonx Discovery + AWS Bedrock Knowledge Bases) → fetch latest RBI/SEBI/FATF circulars dynamically.

Answers the “why” behind approval/rejection in plain language.

AI Agents (Orchestration Layer)

Document Agent: Extracts & validates input docs.

Sanctions Agent: Uses AWS Bedrock for real-time AML/PEP checks with global APIs.

Risk Scoring Agent: Combines ML model + rule-based compliance (jurisdiction-specific).

Compliance Officer Agent: Generates explainable reasoning chain (audit-ready).

Blockchain Layer (Optional but Unique)

Store hashed KYC/KYB records on a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric on AWS).

Ensures immutability, reusability (KYC once, reuse everywhere), and regulatory trust.

Customers/partners can verify authenticity without re-KYC → reduces redundancy.

Self-Learning Compliance

Every manual override by compliance officer → retrains reasoning logic.

Continuous updates from regulatory feeds → no outdated rule enforcement.

3. Customer Accessibility Features

One-Click KYC Reuse: If customer already did KYC with one bank, blockchain hash enables reuse in another.

Explainability-as-a-Service: Customer can request “Why was my KYC flagged?” → app shows AI reasoning chain in simple words.

Fraud Alerts: Real-time SMS/email if identity is used in suspicious onboarding attempts.

Inclusive Design: Support for regional languages, low-bandwidth access, voice-driven onboarding.

4. Why This is Unique

Multi-agent orchestration simulates an actual compliance team.

Hybrid IBM + AWS stack → resilient, cloud-agnostic, enterprise-ready.

Blockchain-enabled reusable KYC → customer convenience + regulatory trust.

Explainable AI (XAI) → builds customer confidence and regulator approval.

Continuous learning compliance engine → adaptive to new regulations.

5. Impact

For Customers: Faster, transparent, and reusable KYC → no repeated hassles.

For Banks/Fintechs: 60%+ cost savings, reduced fraud, global compliance alignment.

For Regulators: Immutable records, full audit trail, easier enforcement.

For Society: Boosts financial inclusion by enabling rural/SME onboarding with minimal friction.

👉 This plan makes KYCmitra more than just a KYC app — it becomes a trust ecosystem for customers, banks, and regulators.

Do you want me to convert this into a final hackathon-ready PPT flow (with polished slide content aligned to your template), so you can directly present it?

You said:
what are the types of kyc and which can can we implement 
ChatGPT said:

Good question 👍 — knowing types of KYC is crucial because your app KYCmitra can implement the right mix depending on feasibility and innovation.

Types of KYC (Know Your Customer)
1. Physical / In-Person KYC

Traditional method: customer visits bank/agent with original documents.

Verification is manual by a compliance officer.
✅ High trust, ❌ slow, ❌ costly.
Not hackathon-friendly.

2. Digital KYC (e-KYC)

Customer uploads documents (Aadhaar, PAN, passport, utility bills, etc.).

AI/ML extracts & validates data against databases (UIDAI, PAN registry).
✅ Fast, scalable.
Implementable in KYCmitra with Watsonx Granite (OCR + entity extraction).

3. Aadhaar-based e-KYC (India-specific)

OTP-based: Aadhaar number + OTP to registered mobile.

Biometric-based: Aadhaar with fingerprint/iris authentication.
✅ Simple for Indian users.
Can be integrated using APIs (UIDAI licensed KUA/AUA).

4. Video KYC (V-CIP as per RBI norms)

Customer connects with agent or AI-driven system via live video call.

AI checks liveness detection, face match with ID proof, geotagging.
✅ RBI approved, contactless, fraud-resistant.
KYCmitra can implement via Watsonx multimodal AI + Bedrock’s Vision models.

5. Central KYC (CKYC)

Customer submits KYC once; CKYC Registry stores & shares with banks/fintechs.
✅ No repeat KYC, regulatory trust.
In KYCmitra, blockchain layer can simulate CKYC-like reusable records.

6. Simplified / Small Account KYC

Minimum documentation (self-declaration + photo ID).

For financial inclusion (low-income / rural customers).
✅ Great social impact.
Can be a feature in KYCmitra for micro-finance / rural onboarding.

7. Corporate KYC (KYB – Know Your Business)

Verification of companies, directors, GSTIN, CIN, beneficial owners.

Requires checking registries, corporate filings, shareholding patterns.
✅ Needed for SMEs/startups onboarding.
KYCmitra can use multi-agent AI + RAG for this.

Which Types KYCmitra Can Implement

For hackathon practicality + uniqueness:

Digital e-KYC (doc upload + AI validation).

Video KYC (AI-driven liveness + face match).

Corporate KYB (multi-agent compliance workflow).

Blockchain-backed reusable KYC (simulated CKYC registry).

Simplified KYC (for financial inclusion module).

👉 This combination shows regulatory alignment (Video KYC + KYB), innovation (Blockchain reuse + AI agents), and social impact (Simplified KYC for rural inclusion).

Do you want me to map these KYC types directly into your PPT solution flow (overview → architecture → novelty → impact) so it’s hackathon-ready?

You said:
what is cdd and edd
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👌 — in the KYC/KYB domain, you’ll often hear about CDD and EDD. These are levels of due diligence applied depending on customer risk.

CDD – Customer Due Diligence

Definition: The standard KYC process done for all customers during onboarding.

Purpose: Verify identity, assess basic risk.

Includes:

Collecting ID proof (Aadhaar, PAN, passport, etc.).

Validating personal details against databases.

Checking against sanctions/PEP (Politically Exposed Person) lists.

Risk scoring (low/medium/high).

When applied: For most retail customers or low-to-medium risk corporate accounts.

✅ Basic level, fast, standard for all banks/fintechs.

EDD – Enhanced Due Diligence

Definition: A deeper investigation for customers flagged as high-risk during CDD.

Purpose: Go beyond normal checks to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud.

Includes:

Detailed background checks (financial history, adverse media, litigation).

Beneficial ownership tracing (who really controls the company).

Source of funds/source of wealth verification.

Continuous monitoring of transactions.

Extra approvals by senior compliance officers.

When applied: For high-risk individuals/companies, such as:

PEPs (politicians, govt officials).

Businesses in high-risk industries (crypto, gambling, arms trade).

Companies linked to tax havens, shell entities, or sanctioned countries.

✅ Higher security, ❌ more time & cost.

In KYCmitra

CDD module: AI agents (Document Agent, Risk Agent) handle standard checks automatically.

EDD module:

Triggered only if risk score > threshold.

Uses Hybrid RAG (Watsonx Discovery + Bedrock KBs) to pull regulator circulars & news.

AI-generated “Enhanced Checklist” → explains what extra docs are needed (like source of funds, beneficial ownership proof).

Blockchain ensures tamper-proof audit trail of EDD decisions.

👉 So, simply:

CDD = standard due diligence (basic KYC).

EDD = deeper investigation (high-risk customers).

Do you want me to add a slide in your PPT explicitly showing how KYCmitra handles both CDD and EDD (with AI automation + agent orchestration)? That would make your solution look regulator-ready and complete.

You said:
on the basis of all the info discussed above give me the final perfect implementation plan also think about that we should make the process of kyc easy also and implementation should be unique 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 Let’s pull everything we’ve discussed — KYC types, CDD/EDD, Blockchain, Multi-Agent AI, IBM + AWS stack — into one final hackathon-ready Implementation Plan for KYCmitra.

This plan is designed to be unique, regulator-friendly, and customer-first, while still realistic to prototype at a hackathon.

Final Implementation Plan – KYCmitra
1. Customer-Centric Approach (Ease of Use)

Simple onboarding flow: Upload ID → Live selfie/video → Done.

Progress tracker: Customers see real-time status (“Docs verified → Risk check → Completed”).

One-click KYC Reuse: If already done elsewhere, blockchain hash validates instantly.

Multi-language, voice-based assistant: Helps rural/elderly users complete KYC easily.

2. Architecture Blueprint

Step 1: Data Capture & Normalization

Upload ID/business documents → IBM Granite multimodal model extracts text & schema with confidence scores.

AI auto-flags anomalies (expired ID, name mismatch, blurry image).

Step 2: Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

Watsonx AI + Bedrock LLM checks identity, registry APIs (PAN, GSTIN, CIN), sanctions/PEP lists.

Risk scoring (low/medium/high).

If low/medium → automated approval within minutes.

Step 3: Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

Triggered for high-risk customers (PEPs, shell companies, tax havens).

Hybrid RAG (Watsonx Discovery + Bedrock KBs) pulls RBI/SEBI/FATF guidelines + adverse media.

AI-generated “EDD Checklist” for extra docs (source of funds, ownership proofs).

Multi-agent system:

Document Agent (validation)

Sanctions Agent (AML/PEP screening)

Risk Scoring Agent (ML + rules)

Compliance Officer Agent (explainable AI → generates reasoning chain).

Step 4: Blockchain Layer

KYC record hashed → stored on permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger/AWS QLDB).

Benefits:

Reuse: Customer won’t redo KYC for every bank/fintech.

Immutability: Audit trail for regulators.

Fraud prevention: Instant detection if same ID used suspiciously.

Step 5: Self-Learning Compliance

If compliance officer overrides AI → system updates reasoning logic.

New regulations auto-reflected via RAG refresh → compliance is always live and evolving.

3. Key Features that Make KYC Easy

Video KYC with AI liveness check – no branch visit required.

Multilingual conversational onboarding (Watson Assistant + Bedrock fallback).

Blockchain-backed reusable KYC – “Do KYC once, use everywhere.”

Explainable AI outputs – customer can ask “Why was my KYC flagged?” → plain language reasoning.

Lightweight, low-bandwidth app – accessible in rural/low-infra areas.

4. Uniqueness of KYCmitra

Hybrid AI stack (IBM + AWS): Resilient, cloud-agnostic, enterprise-ready.

Multi-Agent orchestration: AI simulates a compliance team (extraction, sanctions, risk, audit).

Blockchain-enabled reusable KYC: No repeat hassle for customers.

Explainable AI (XAI): Every decision comes with reasoning → regulator-trusted, customer-friendly.

Financial inclusion mode: Simplified KYC for SMEs/rural users with minimal docs.

5. Impact

For Customers:

Faster onboarding (< 5 minutes retail, < 24 hrs corporate).

Transparency (“Why flagged?” answers).

No repeat KYC.

For Banks/Fintechs:

40–60% cost savings in compliance.

Lower fraud risk, fewer regulatory fines.

Scalable KYB for SMEs and global expansion.

For Regulators:

Immutable blockchain audit trails.

Easy proof of compliance.

Continuous alignment with updated AML/KYC norms.

✅ This plan makes KYCmitra stand out: AI-powered, blockchain-backed, regulator-ready, and customer-first.

Do you want me to now restructure your PPT slides (solution overview → architecture → novelty → impact) with this final plan so you can directly present it in the hackathon?

One-click KYC Reuse: If already done elsewhere, blockchain hash validates instantly. how should we implement this
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 21s

Awesome—here’s a crisp, build-ready plan for One-Click KYC Reuse using a hash-anchored, consented credential that any partner can verify instantly, without re-KYC.

One-Click KYC Reuse — Implementation
0) Design goals

Zero PII on-chain (hashes/anchors only)

User consent first (revocable)

Instant verification (no re-upload)

Interoperable (works across banks/fintechs)

1) Data model (off-chain + on-chain)
Off-chain “KYC Bundle”

Canonical JSON (stable ordering + types)

{
  "subject": {"did": "did:kyc:abc…", "name": "…", "dob": "…", "id_docs": [...]},
  "checks": {"pep": "clear", "sanctions": "clear", "video_kyc": "passed"},
  "issuer": {"did": "did:bank:xyz…", "name": "Bank A"},
  "issued_at": "2025-08-27T12:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-08-27T12:00:00Z",
  "jurisdiction": "IN",
  "policy_version": "RBI-vCIP-2025-06"
}


Stored in S3 (or IBM COS), KMS-encrypted.

Signed as a W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) by issuer (Bank/regulated RE) with its private key.

Build a Merkle tree over selected fields → store merkleRoot inside the VC for selective proofs later.

On-chain “Anchor” (immutable, no PII)

anchorId = SHA-256( canonicalVC + userSalt )

Record:

{ anchorId, issuerDID, subjectDID, merkleRoot, issuedAt, expiresAt, revocationStatus, policyVersion }


Lives on permissioned ledger:

Hackathon-fast path: Amazon QLDB (ledger + PartiQL, super quick to ship).

Enterprise path: Hyperledger Fabric (Amazon Managed Blockchain) or IBM Blockchain Platform.

2) Cryptography & privacy

Canonicalization: JSON-LD Canonicalization (URDNA2015) or deterministic key order to ensure stable hashing.

Salting: Per-user random userSalt (stored encrypted off-chain) to prevent hash-linkage across issuers.

Pepper: Service-level secret inside HSM/KMS (optional) for extra unlinkability.

Signatures: VC signed with issuer’s key (stored in HSM/KMS or IBM Hyper Protect Crypto Services).

Selective disclosure (nice-to-have): BBS+ / Merkle inclusion proofs so users reveal only needed fields.

3) Smart contract / Ledger tables
If Fabric (chaincode sketch)

putAnchor(anchorId, issuerDID, subjectDID, merkleRoot, issuedAt, expiresAt, policyVersion)

revoke(anchorId, reason)

status(anchorId) -> {exists, revoked, expiresAt, issuerDID}

If QLDB (tables)

Anchors(anchorId PK, issuerDID, subjectDID, merkleRoot, issuedAt, expiresAt, policyVersion, revoked=false)

Consents(anchorId, verifierDID, status, scope, ttl)

Use QLDB history for audit (no custom smart contract needed).

4) Consent & presentation flow (what the user sees)

Issuance (first KYC)

KYCmitra completes CDD/Video-KYC → builds canonical VC + Merkle root.

Compute anchorId and write to ledger.

Store encrypted VC in S3/COS; user’s wallet (in-app) stores a copy + userSalt.

Show “KYC reusable until 27-Aug-2026”.

Reuse (at another fintech/bank)

Fintech shows “One-Click KYC with KYCmitra” → deep link / QR.

User approves scoped consent (what fields, validity, verifierDID).

App generates Presentation:

Selected claims (or Merkle proofs) from VC,

VC signature,

anchorId (recomputed client-side using stored userSalt to avoid PII),

Consent token (JWT) signed by user.

Verification (milliseconds)

Verifier fetches anchor from ledger by anchorId.

Checks:

Not revoked + not expired,

Issuer DID is trusted (in allow-list),

VC signature valid,

If selective disclosure, Merkle proof matches on-chain merkleRoot.

If all good → accept, no re-KYC. Otherwise fall back to standard KYC.

Revocation / update

Issuer (or regulator order) can set revoked=true on anchor.

User can withdraw consent (future verifications fail unless re-approved).

Re-KYC produces a new anchorId, old one marked superseded.

5) APIs (quick to build)

Issuer service (KYCmitra)

POST /issue → returns { anchorId, vcUrl, expiresAt }

POST /revoke → { anchorId, reason }

POST /consent/grant → { anchorId, verifierDID, scope, ttl }

Verifier service (partner)

POST /present body: { anchorId, vc, merkleProofs?, consentJWT }

On server:

GET ledger/anchor/{anchorId}

Verify VC signature (issuer DID)

Verify Merkle proofs (if any)

Check consent & expiry

Respond { verdict: "pass", level: "CDD-reused" }

6) Tech stack mapping

Ledger:

MVP: Amazon QLDB (fast, fully-managed, cryptographic digest).

Alt: Hyperledger Fabric on Amazon Managed Blockchain or IBM Blockchain.

Keys & crypto: AWS KMS / IBM Hyper Protect Crypto Services.

Storage: S3 / IBM COS with SSE-KMS, bucket policies, object-lock (WORM) for audit.

Identity: DIDs (did:web for hackathon simplicity), DID documents hosted on your domain.

App: Mobile/Web React; Wallet module stores VC + userSalt; QR/deeplink for verifiers.

7) Hackathon-ready build plan (2–3 days)

Day 1

Define KYC canonical JSON + Merkle builder.

VC signer (JOSE/JWS).

QLDB table Anchors + Consents; PUT /issue.

Day 2

Wallet UI: “Share KYC” (scope select → QR).

Verifier API POST /present:

VC signature check,

QLDB anchor check,

Merkle proof verify.

Day 3

Consent UI + JWT.

Revocation endpoint & demo.

Nice-to-have: selective disclosure (Merkle proofs) + audit screen.

8) Threat model & mitigations

Linkage/correlation: salted+peppered hashes; no PII on-chain.

Compromised storage: encrypted blobs + short-lived pre-signed URLs.

Key compromise: HSM/KMS, key rotation, DID method update.

Replay: consent JWT with nonce + TTL; verifier checks ledger freshness.

Regulatory audits: full QLDB history / Fabric block proofs + decision trace from KYCmitra.

9) What to demo (judges love this)

User finishes KYC once → sees “Reusable until …”.

At Partner App: tap “One-Click KYC”, scan QR → approved in <2s.

Show ledger anchor, consent record, and no raw PII ever left the user’s phone.

TL;DR

Store only a salted hash + Merkle root of the signed KYC credential on an immutable ledger. Keep the full encrypted credential off-chain with the user. On reuse, the user consents and presents a verifiable proof; the verifier checks the on-chain anchor and signature → instant, private, regulator-friendly reuse.

how to implement blockchain in our project start from basic
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 🔥 You want a step-by-step roadmap for implementing blockchain in your KYCmitra project starting from basics. I’ll break it down so you can go from idea → prototype → hackathon-ready demo.

Implementing Blockchain in KYCmitra – Step by Step
1. Understand WHY Blockchain is Needed in KYC

Problem: Customers repeat KYC at every bank/fintech.

Solution: “KYC once, reuse everywhere.”

Blockchain Role:

Immutability – Records can’t be tampered with.

Auditability – Regulators trust it.

Decentralized Trust – Multiple banks/fintechs share the same ledger.

Privacy – Only hashes/anchors stored, not full data.

2. Choose Blockchain Type

For KYCmitra, permissioned blockchain is best:

Why not public (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)? → Not regulator-friendly, privacy concerns.

Best fit:

Amazon QLDB (ledger DB, easy hackathon choice)

Hyperledger Fabric (open-source, widely used in financial consortia)

IBM Blockchain Platform (managed Fabric)

👉 For hackathon: start with Amazon QLDB (fast, no node setup, cryptographic proof built-in). Later migrate to Fabric if needed.

3. What to Store On-Chain

⚠️ Never store raw KYC data (PII).
Instead, store proofs:

Hash of KYC Record

Example: SHA256( canonical JSON of verified KYC )

Metadata:

Issuer ID (bank/fintech that did KYC)

Timestamp

Expiry date

Status (active / revoked)

✅ This makes blockchain a “KYC validity registry”.

4. Off-Chain Storage

Actual KYC docs → encrypted in S3 (AWS) or IBM Cloud Object Storage.

User wallet/app stores the encrypted credential + salt used for hashing.

Blockchain only stores the hash + anchor for verification.

5. Implementation Flow
(A) KYC Creation

Customer completes e-KYC/Video-KYC in KYCmitra.

Generate a canonical JSON credential (name, DOB, ID numbers, verification result).

Compute hash (SHA256).

Store full credential in encrypted storage (S3/IBM COS).

Write hash + metadata → blockchain ledger.

(B) KYC Reuse (One-Click)

At new bank/fintech, customer clicks “Reuse my KYC”.

KYCmitra presents:

The credential (from encrypted store).

Proof (hash) to match ledger.

Verifier queries blockchain:

Checks hash exists, not revoked, not expired.

Confirms issuer (trusted bank/RE).

✅ Instantly accepts → no fresh KYC.

(C) Revocation

If user withdraws consent or regulator revokes:

Update ledger entry → status = revoked.

Any future verifier sees it as invalid.

6. Tech Setup
Option 1 – Amazon QLDB (Hackathon Easy Mode)

Create a QLDB ledger (1 click in AWS console).

Define a table KYC_Anchors:

CREATE TABLE KYC_Anchors;


Insert anchor:

INSERT INTO KYC_Anchors 
VALUE { 
  anchorId: "hash123", 
  issuer: "BankA", 
  issuedAt: "2025-08-27", 
  expiresAt: "2026-08-27", 
  status: "active" 
};


Query & verify with PartiQL.

QLDB automatically gives an immutable history + cryptographic digest.

Option 2 – Hyperledger Fabric (Enterprise Mode)

Deploy Fabric network (banks/fintechs as peers).

Write a chaincode (smart contract):

addKYC(anchorId, issuer, expiry, status)

getKYC(anchorId)

revokeKYC(anchorId)

Use Fabric SDK (Node.js/Go/Python) to connect from KYCmitra app.

7. Development Plan (Hackathon-Ready)

Day 1

Set up QLDB / Fabric testnet.

Build credential → hash generator.

Store anchor in blockchain.

Day 2

Build API for verifiers: /checkKYC(anchorId) → returns validity.

Build wallet UI in app → “One-Click Reuse”.

Day 3

Add revocation endpoint.

Add demo flow: User → Bank A (KYC) → Bank B (Reuse).

Show blockchain ledger entry & proof in demo.

8. Example Demo Scenario

User Alice does KYC at Bank A via KYCmitra.

Hash written to blockchain: hashA123.

Alice applies at Fintech B → clicks One-Click KYC.

Fintech B queries blockchain → sees hashA123 issued by Bank A, active, valid.

✅ Instantly approves Alice without redoing KYC.

If later Alice’s KYC is revoked → ledger shows revoked → reuse fails.

✅ With this, your blockchain piece looks unique (reuse + immutability), practical (easy flow for customers), and regulator-ready (audit trail, revocation).

Do you want me to give you a sample smart contract (Fabric chaincode) or a QLDB PartiQL script that you can directly show in your PPT/demo?

KYC Reuse (One-Click)

At new bank/fintech, customer clicks “Reuse my KYC”.

KYCmitra presents:

The credential (from encrypted store).

Proof (hash) to match ledger.

Verifier queries blockchain:

Checks hash exists, not revoked, not expired.

Confirms issuer (trusted bank/RE).

✅ Instantly accepts → no fresh KYC.
at new bank what input is it taking to match from the old proof
ChatGPT said:

Great follow-up 🙌 — you’ve zeroed in on the core question:

👉 At the new bank/fintech, what input do they use to match the “old proof” from blockchain?

Here’s the flow simplified:

Inputs at the New Bank (Verifier)

When the customer clicks “Reuse my KYC”, KYCmitra (the user’s app/wallet) sends a Presentation Package containing:

KYC Credential (off-chain, encrypted)

The original verified KYC data (JSON + docs summary), signed by the original issuer (Bank A).

This is not stored on-chain, but shared directly with the new verifier (Bank B).

Anchor Proof (hash)

Hash = SHA256(canonicalized KYC credential + userSalt).

This is the unique fingerprint written to the blockchain when Bank A first did the KYC.

User Consent Token (JWT)

Signed by the user to prove they agreed to share this credential with Bank B.

Contains scope (what fields can be shared, validity time).

What the New Bank Does

Step 1: Hash recomputation

Bank B takes the credential it just received, canonicalizes it, and recomputes SHA256(credential + userSalt).

Step 2: Blockchain lookup

Queries blockchain for that hash (anchorId).

Checks if:

status = active

expiry > today

issuer is in the trusted issuers list (RBI-regulated bank/RE).

Step 3: Signature verification

Verifies that the credential was originally signed by Bank A (issuer’s DID/public key).

Step 4: Accept/Reject

If all checks pass ✅ → Bank B accepts instantly, no fresh KYC needed.

If hash not found / expired / revoked ❌ → fallback to fresh KYC.

So the exact input is:

Credential (off-chain JSON, signed)

Anchor hash (proof to match ledger)

UserSalt (so verifier can recompute the same hash)

User consent token (so customer controls reuse)

⚡ This way, the new bank never guesses anything from scratch — it just recomputes the hash from the credential provided by the user and checks it against the blockchain anchor.

Do you want me to draw a simple flow diagram (User → Bank A → Blockchain → Bank B) showing these inputs and verification steps so you can put it directly into your hackathon PPT?

You said:
give the exact input that we should ask at new bank image, text what fields etc and how we will match that with the old data
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — you want the exact fields / inputs a new bank (Bank B) should ask from the customer when they say “Reuse my KYC”, and how those inputs are matched against the old proof stored in the blockchain.

Let’s break it into customer-facing inputs and backend matching logic.

At the New Bank (Bank B) – Inputs to Collect
From the Customer (via KYCmitra app)

Identity Credential (JSON package) – generated & signed at the first KYC (Bank A).
Fields inside:

Full Name

Date of Birth

Government ID details (Aadhaar No./PAN/Passport No. → masked except last 4 digits)

Address

Photo

KYC status (verified / expired / revoked)

Issuer (Bank A’s ID/DID)

Issued At, Expires At

Digital signature of Bank A

👉 This is encrypted & sent directly from customer’s KYCmitra wallet.

Hash Proof (Anchor ID)

Pre-computed: SHA256(canonicalized credential + userSalt)

This is the unique fingerprint written to blockchain.

UserSalt (private random value tied to the credential)

Lets Bank B recompute the same hash.

Without it, the credential cannot be linked.

Consent Token (JWT)

Proves the user authorized sharing with Bank B.

Contains scope (share_name, dob, id_no_last4), validity, and user’s digital signature.

Optional (for risk/scoring at Bank B)

Live selfie image (for liveness + face match with credential photo).

Additional ID number (last 4 digits) typed by user → cross-check with credential JSON.

Backend Matching Logic (How Bank B Verifies)

Recompute hash

Take the received credential JSON.

Canonicalize it (stable field ordering).

Append userSalt.

Run SHA256.

Result = newHash.

Blockchain check

Query ledger for newHash.

Ensure:

Hash exists in ledger.

status = active.

expiry > current date.

issuer = trusted RE (Bank A).

Verify digital signature

Credential must have Bank A’s signature.

Validate using Bank A’s registered public key / DID.

Cross-check biometric (optional)

If Bank B requires stronger assurance:

Compare selfie (freshly captured) with credential photo (in JSON).

Decision

If all checks ✅ → Bank B accepts instantly.

If mismatch / revoked / expired ❌ → request full KYC.

So Exact Inputs Needed at Bank B

From KYCmitra (user’s wallet):

Credential JSON (Name, DOB, ID details, Address, Photo, Issuer, Signature)

Anchor Hash (proof)

UserSalt

Consent Token

From Customer (live input at reuse):

Fresh selfie (optional, for liveness check)

ID last 4 digits (optional, quick human-readable match)

👉 This way, Bank B doesn’t re-run full KYC, it just recomputes the hash and matches with the blockchain anchor to prove the credential is authentic and unchanged.

Would you like me to give you a sample JSON structure for the credential + hash proof (so you can show in demo / PPT how Bank B actually receives and verifies it)?

Veratad + Blockchain-ID	Partial	Algorand-based token	KYC tokens compatible with wallets
Hashbon Pass	Yes	NFT-based on public blockchain	Anonymous KYC tokens for DeFi apps
Final Takeaway

Yes, several players—especially in Web3 and RegTech—are already offering reusable KYC frameworks with decentralized or blockchain elements. However:

Most solutions either lack a hybrid AI + blockchain architecture, or

Don’t offer full explainability (XAI), or

Don’t support both individual and corporate KYC reuse, or

May lack low-bandwidth accessibility or multi-lingual support as envisioned in KYCmitra.

KYCmitra’s differentiators:

Combines multi-agent AI (IBM + AWS) with blockchain anchors,

Supports both retail and corporate KYC,

Includes explainable reasoning chain and self-learning compliance,

Ensures regulator-friendly audits while keeping UX seamless and inclusive.

Indian Blockchain-Based KYC Initiatives
Belfrics – Belrium

Developed a hybrid public/private blockchain called Belrium, initially targeted at ID issuance and verification.

Vision: Government, banks, and tax agencies share KYC via blockchain for efficiency.

However, it’s not clear if this is live in India or widespread in practice.

Summary — Indian KYC Landscape
Company/Initiative	Reusable KYC?	Blockchain / Decentralized Element?	Standout Capability
KYCPLUS	Re-KYC ability	No	Fast, modular KYC/KYB + CKYC integration
IDfy	No	No	AI-based e-KYC, video KYC, high scale
Signzy	No	No	No-code onboarding, tailored workflows
HyperVerge / inVOID / SignDesk	No	No	Video KYC automation
Cashfree SecureID / KYC Link	No	No	Multilingual, low-bandwidth video KYC; no-code links
Belfrics – Belrium	Potentially	Yes (hybrid blockchain)	Blockchain KYC vision, ID issuance
Key Takeaways

No Indian competitor currently offers a seamless, blockchain-anchored, reusable KYC system like KYCmitra proposes.

Most Indian players excel in fast, AI-powered KYC and video onboarding, but rely on fresh verification each time.

Belfrics’ Belrium is unique in being blockchain-focused—but appears to be more conceptual or limited in scope, not standard adopted.

KYCmitra’s Unique Edge in India

Cross-institutional KYC reuse with blockchain for secure, instant verification.

Explainable AI + multi-agent compliance layered over KYC to build audit trails and transparency.

Inclusive UX—low-bandwidth support, multilingual flows, rural accessibility.

Smart fallback—seamless reuse when possible, with secure re-KYC when needed.
